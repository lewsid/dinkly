# I. Introduction

Dinkly is a modest little MVC (model, view, controller) PHP framework inspired by Ruby on Rails and earlier (simpler) incarnations of Symfony. It was designed from the ground-up to be fast, easy to understand, highly customizable, and have a small footprint. The Dinkly framework comes with everything you need to build a basic web application, and excels when used for rapid prototyping, though it is perfectly capable of handling much larger, more sophisticated, use-cases.
